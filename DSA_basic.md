# Data Structures  
Data Structures are methods of organizing and storing data efficiently to allow easy access, modification, and management as required.

# Algorithm  
An Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a specific problem or perform a computation.

# Importance of Data Structures  
1. **Problem Solving**  
   Data Structures provide efficient solutions to real-world problems.  

2. **Efficiency**  
   Proper use of data structures improves the time and space efficiency of a program.  

3. **Code Optimization**  
   Optimized code with appropriate data structures runs faster and consumes fewer resources.  

4. **Job Interviews**  
   Knowledge of Data Structures is essential for coding interviews and technical assessments in job placements.

# Types of Data Structures  
1. **Linear Data Structures**  
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**

## Linear Data Structures  
Linear Data Structures are those where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. In these structures, each element is connected to its previous and next adjacent elements.  

**Examples:** Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

## Non-Linear Data Structures  
Non-Linear Data Structures are those where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly. Instead, they are connected in a hierarchical or complex relationship.  

**Examples:** Trees, Graphs.
