# Array  
An **Array** is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in an array is identified by a unique index number.

---

## Key Characteristics of an Array  
- Arrays store elements **sequentially** in contiguous memory locations.  
- Arrays allow **random access** to elements using their index.  
- Arrays are a type of **Linear Data Structure**.  
- Arrays store similar or **homogeneous elements**.  

---

## Example:  
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

## Key Applications:  
1. **Storing Information in a Linear Fashion**  
   Arrays organize data sequentially, making it easy to traverse and access.  

2. **Frequent Searching Operations**  
   Arrays provide efficient searching methods such as **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**.  

3. **Matrix Representation**  
   Arrays are used to represent and perform operations on matrices in programming.  

4. **Storing and Accessing Data**  
   Arrays allow quick access to elements using their index, making them suitable for data retrieval tasks.

## Real-World Examples:  
1. **Storing Data in Tabular Format**  
   Arrays are used to store data in rows and columns, similar to tables in spreadsheets.  

2. **Storing Contacts on Your Phone**  
   The contact list on a phone is implemented as an array where each contact can be accessed using an index.

## One-Dimensional Array (1D Array)  
 * A **1D array** can be visualized as a single row of elements. <br>
 * The elements are stored sequentially, one after the other.<br>
 * A 1D array contains only one subscript (index) to access each element.

---

## 1D Array Declaration and Initialization  
datatype var_name[3];
arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};

---

## Two-Dimensional Array (2D Array)  
* A **2D array** can be visualized as a table or matrix.<br>
* The elements are stored one after another, <br>
    i.e., one 1D array inside another. <br>
* In a 2D array, we use **two subscripts (indices)** to access elements.

---

## 2D Array Declaration and Initialization  
To declare a 2D array, the syntax is as follows:
```c
datatype variable_name[rowsize][col_size];
